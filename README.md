# Predicting the Degree of Misalignment

This project applies Machine Learning to predict the degree of misalignment in conductor casing operations, a crucial aspect of oil and gas drilling. Developed as part of my final year research at Covenant University, this project showcases how data-driven models can improve well integrity and reduce costs.

## 📌 Project Overview

Misalignment in casing operations can lead to long-term structural and economic issues. In this project, we train and evaluate different regression models to predict misalignment levels based on historical well data.

## Project Structure

- `Predicting Misalignment.ipynb` — Complete workflow: from data loading to model evaluation
- `data/` — (Not included) Placeholder for dataset
- `models/` — (Optional) Folder to save trained models

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Multiple model comparison: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVR, Neural Networks
- Performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, R² Score

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predicting-misalignment.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd predicting-misalignment
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📊 Results

After tuning and comparison, the **Random Forest Regressor** performed best, achieving an **R² score of approximately *\[insert score]***, with good generalization performance on test data.

## 📚 Background

This research aims to improve operational safety and efficiency in petroleum engineering using machine learning. With predictive insights, drilling engineers can reduce misalignment risks early in the design phase.
